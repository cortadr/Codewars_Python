********* PROBLEM **********

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

********* SOLUTION **********

from collections import Counter
def find_uniq(arr):
# Count the occurrences of each number in the array
    count_dict = Counter(arr)
    
    # Find the number with a count of 1 (unique number)
    for num, count in count_dict.items():
        if count == 1:
            return num
#     first = 0
#     last = len(arr)-1
#     while first <= last:
#         if arr[first] == arr[last]:
#             unique = arr[first]
#             first += 1
#             if arr[first] != unique:
#                 return arr[first]
#         else:
#             first += 1
