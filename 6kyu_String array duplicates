********* PROBLEM **********

In this Kata, you will be given an array of strings and your task is to remove all consecutive duplicate letters from each string in the array.

For example:

dup(["abracadabra","allottee","assessee"]) = ["abracadabra","alote","asese"].

dup(["kelless","keenness"]) = ["keles","kenes"].

Strings will be lowercase only, no spaces. See test cases for more examples.

Good luck!

********* SOLUTION **********

def dup(arry):
    result = []
    
    for word in arry:
        new_string = ""
        prev_letter = ""
        for letter in word:
            if letter != prev_letter:
                new_string += letter
                prev_letter = letter
        
        result.append(new_string)
    return result
