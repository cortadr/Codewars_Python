********* PROBLEM **********

Assume "#" is like a backspace in string. This means that string "a#bc#d" actually is "bd"

Your task is to process a string with "#" symbols.

Examples
"abc#d##c"      ==>  "ac"
"abc##d######"  ==>  ""
"#######"       ==>  ""
""              ==>  ""

********* SOLUTION **********

def clean_string(s):
    res = []
    for i in s:
        if i == '#' and res:
            res.pop()
        elif i != '#':
            res.append(i)
    return ''.join(res)
